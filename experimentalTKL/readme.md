# experimentalTKL
- This is a gag keyboard I built for my father for Christmas 2024. It's a quick
and dirty TKL mechanical keyboadrd with rotary dial as a numpad.
- Firmware and 3D printed parts are based on remonpel/rp_full_ansi that you can
find [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5887799)

## Hardware
- this keyboard is based on full size Raspberry Pi Pico
- numpad uses Pro Micro to communicate with the computer
- inside of the keyboard there is a USB splitter that connects both RPIp a Pro Micro
to the computer via single wire

### ToDo
[ ] upload .ino files for numpad part
[ ] add keyboards .STL files
